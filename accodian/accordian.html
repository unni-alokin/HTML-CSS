            <p>Sir Lewis Carl Davidson Hamilton MBE HonFREng is a British racing driver currently competing in Formula One for Mercedes.
                In Formula One, Hamilton has won a joint-record seven World Drivers'Championship titles, and holds the records for 
                the most wins, pole positions, and podium finishes, among others.
                Born and raised in Stevenage, Hertfordshire, Hamilton joined the McLaren young driver programme in 1998. This led to a Formula One drive with McLaren from 2007 to 2012, making Hamilton the first, and so far only, black driver to race in the series. In his inaugural season, Hamilton set numerous records as he finished runner-up to Kimi Räikkönen by one point. The following season, he won his maiden title in dramatic fashion—making a crucial overtake on the last lap of the last race of the season—to
                become the then-youngest Formula One World Champion in history. After six years with McLaren, Hamilton signed with Mercedes in
                2013.Changes to the regulations for 2014 mandating the use of turbo-hybrid engines saw the
                start of a highly successful period for Hamilton, during which he has won six further drivers' titles. 
                Consecutive titles came in 2014 and 2015 during an intense rivalry with teammate Nico Rosberg. Following Rosberg's 
                retirement, Ferrari's Sebastian Vettel became Hamilton's closest rival in two intense championship battles, in which
                Hamilton twice overturned mid-season point deficits to claim consecutive titles again in 2017 and 2018. His third 
                and fourth consecutive titles followed in 2019 and 2020 to equal Schumacher's record of seven drivers' titles.

                successful run in junior karting and single-seater categories –including KF3, WSK World Series, KZ2 and European
                Formula 3 – beating several records.
                At the 2015 Australian Grand Prix, when he was aged 17 years, 166 days, he became the youngest driver to compete in Formula One. 
                After spending the 2015 season with Scuderia Toro Rosso, Verstappen started his 2016 campaign with the Italian team before being 
                promoted to parent team Red Bull Racing after four races as a replacement for Daniil Kvyat. At the age of 18, he won the 2016 
                Spanish GrandPrix on his debut for Red Bull Racing, becoming the youngest-ever driver and the first Dutch driver to win a Formula One Grand Prix.
