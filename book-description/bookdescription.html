            <p class="description">
                The story takes place in Taish≈ç-era Japan, where a secret society, known as the 
                Demon Slayer Corps, has been waging a secret war against demons for centuries.
                The demons are former humans who were turned into demons by Muzan Kibutsuji injecting 
                them with his own blood, and they feed on humans and possess supernatural abilities
                 such as super strength, powers that demons can obtain called "Blood Demon Art", and 
                 regeneration. Demons can only be killed if they are decapitated with weapons crafted 
                 from an alloy known as Nichirin, injected with poison extracted from wisteria flowers,
                  or exposed to sunlight.This helps them fight against demons. The strongest Demon Slayers are known as the Hashira.

            <p class="description"> 
                A powerful fox known as the Nine-Tails attacks Konoha, the 
                hidden leaf village in the Land of Fire, one of the Five Great Shinobi 
                Countries in the Ninja World. In response, the leader of Konoha and the Fourth Hokage,
                Minato Namikaze seals the fox inside the body of his newborn son, Naruto Uzumaki,
                making Naruto a host of the beast;[i] this costs Naruto's father his life, and the 
                Third Hokage returns from retirement to become the leader of Konoha again. Naruto 
                is often scorned by Konoha's villagers for being the host of the Nine-Tails. Due to
                a decree by the Third Hokage forbidding any mention of these events, Naruto learns 
                nothing about the Nine-Tails until 12 years later, when Mizuki, a renegade ninja,
                reveals the truth to Naruto. Naruto then defeats Mizuki in combat, earning the respect of his teacher, Iruka Umino.

                <p class="description">In order to maintain the state of peace between the rival nations of 
                    Westalis and Ostania,[b] a Westalian agent code-named "Twilight" is tasked with 
                    spying on Donovan Desmond, leader of the National Unity Party within Ostania. However, 
                    due to Desmond being notoriously reclusive, the only way Twilight can get close to him 
                    is to enroll a child in the same private school as Desmond's sons and pose as a 
                    fellow parent. To accomplish this and present the image of a happy family, he creates the alias
                     of Loid Forger, adopts a young orphan girl named Anya, and marries a woman 
                     named Yor Briar. </p>

                    According to the knowledge propagated locally, it is the last surviving vestige of human 
                    civilization. Its inhabitants, known as Eldians, have been led to believe that over 
                    one hundred years ago, humanity was driven to the brink of extinction after the emergence
                     of humanoid giants called Titans, who attack and eat humans on sight. The last remnants
                      of humanity retreated behind three concentric walls and enjoyed roughly a century of 
                      peace. Within the walls, the thought of venturing outside is strongly frowned upon and 
                      discouraged. To combat Titans, the country's military employs Vertical 
                    Maneuvering Equipment (VME), also called Omni-Directional Maneuvering Gear (ODM Gear)
