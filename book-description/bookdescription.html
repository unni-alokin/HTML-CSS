            <h2 class="bookname">THE VELDT</h2>
            <p class="author">by RayBradbury,1950</p>
            <p>
                "The Veldt" is a dystopian story by Ray Bradbury. Even though the story is only a 
                few pages long and appears relatively simple, it contains many concepts that 
                should be thought about, as well as consequences of total reliance on technologies.
            </p>
            <p>In this story, people got houses that did everything for them, 
                such as bathing them, feeding them, rocking them to sleep, etc. 
                This was one of the problems that led to the demise of Mr. and 
                Mrs. Hadley. What surprised me was that it wasn’t the artificial 
                technology itself that directly spelled doom -- it was the lasting
                 effect of the artificial technology. All those machines had eliminated
                  any essence of love from child to parent. The children, Peter and Wendy,
                  had no scruples about locking their mom and dad in an African savanna. 
                  Their love was not for their parents-it was for the house and the machinery.
